Shambho's Kirtan Songbook

Here you will find a list of all the chants I've learned throughout the years from many different sources.
 
Some are well-known classics, some are personal compositions and some are adaptations.

This mostly acts as my personal songbook and the idea is to have a short audio sample with chords and words to refresh the memory.

The audio samples found here are not meant to represent the chants in their final form or to be listened to as a good performance.

They are quick one take recordings without prior practice that act as a reminder of the core to get the fire started. (pitch warning ;))

Each section is played briefly but in reality the different sections are much longer and organic in their transition.

I chose to record it this way because it would've taken a very long time to record all the full chants properly.

It's up to us to create them in the moment! That being said, I might update the audio with full chants sung as a group when I have good recordings.

I decided to make this page public since resources for learning chants online are quite sparse.
If you want to sing it in a higher or lower key, you can use the website "TabTuner" to easily transpose chords to your liking.
 
Have fun exploring and see you in the sound!

For any questions or suggestions you can reach me at : raffael.jomphe@gmail.com
Over time I lost track of who sings what so if you have the name of the artist to add to a chant i'll gladly do so.
